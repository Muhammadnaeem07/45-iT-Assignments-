// • Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.
// • Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used. If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying that the username is available.
